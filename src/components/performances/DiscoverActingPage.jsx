          The Discover Acting course, developed by the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London, 
          provided an in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of acting. This highly interactive course combined 
          practical exercises, theoretical insights, and performance analysis to help learners develop a strong 
          foundation in the art of acting.

        <p className="mt-4">
          Through a structured curriculum that covered text analysis, vocal and physical training, and monologue 
          performance, I was able to explore the actor's craft in a way that directly complements my journey as a filmmaker.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          The course introduced acting as more than just reciting linesâ€”it is a multi-layered process where the actor 
          must inhabit a character's physical, emotional, and psychological world. This knowledge broadened my 
          perspective as a filmmaker, emphasizing how an actor's gestures, expressions, and silences can shape the narrative.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Beyond acting, this course deepened my understanding of how actors build compelling characters, allowing me 
          to approach filmmaking with a stronger directorial vision. It helped me see how movement, silence, and 
          subtle expressions contribute to a scene's emotional impact.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Completing Discover Acting was a transformative experience that sharpened my skills not only as a performer 
          but also as a storyteller. The ability to analyze scripts, guide actors, and recognize the nuances of 
          physical and vocal performance will greatly influence my approach to filmmaking.
